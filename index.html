            <h4> First Step </h4>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">The first step to Kung Fu is to know what style you want to learn and why. After meditating on the style and why you chose it. Example: Tong Bei Quan is the perfect syle for an individual that wants to fight with the strength of a silverback
                gorrila, Tai Chi for energy flow and Bagua for indivials with back problem. Lets say you wanted to get "Straight" to the point, then you should explore Wing Chun. After chosing your style it's time to look where is has come from. You can
                not properly apply Kung Fu in a physical or life situation if you don't know what the intentioin or origin of the styles you are perssuing.</p>

            <h4> Second Step </h4>
            <p>Now that you've chosen a style and know why and what it was intentionally designed to do you may now seek a teacher. WARNING: Beware of fakes. Take the time to research diffrent locations of schools or locations of practitionors. It is important
                that your instructor has had real life experince when it comes to finding the right teacher many make faulse claims. The best thing to do is start researching the indiviuals that are best known within/for that style, watch their videos,
                read their books and articles. At least get a visual understanding of what you are looking for, that way when the universe brings it to you you'll know. </p>

        <h4> Third Step </h4>
        <p>Self preperation and walking into your first class will be your next step. Self preperation is physical, mental and spiritual just like Kung Fu as a whole. Physically you can get your body ready for the specific movents you will be making within
            your style. Streching and dynamic movments are great along with strength training. Mentally you may need to humble yourself by emtying your metiphorical cups and go is as if you know nothing. Daily medition is great for this.
